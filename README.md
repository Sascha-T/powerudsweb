# PowerUDS Web
*Because for some reason doing Bluetooth with Java is a pain...*

## [Here is a GitHub pages hosted version!](https://sascha-t.github.io/powerudsweb/)
*You should use dark mode. There is a light mode but I'm for sure not testing it...*

## Why?
I want to make a tool that can perform various tasks over UDS with an ELM327 because I'm too lazy to continuously carry around OEM VCIs, even though most legitimate Bluetooth ELM327 Dongles can do most of the same.
(These dongles exclusively support the OBDII canbus though, and not any other canbusses potentially present in the vehicles OBD receptacle.)
